# Changelog

## 1.13.0-alpha.1

- Convex queries, mutations, and actions now accept `returns:` property to
  specify a return value validator.

  Return value validators throw a runtime error (so will roll back the
  transaction in a mutation) when the value returned from a query or mutation
  does not match this validator. This is _stricter than TypeScript_ in that
  extra properties will not be allowed.

- Validator fields are now exposed: the return value of `v.object({ ... })` now
  has a `.fields` property with the validators for each property on it.

  ```
  const message = v.object({ user: v.string(), body: v.string() });
  const imageMessage = v.object({ ...message.fields, })
  ```

  These validators are also exposed on the schema at
  `schema.tables.messages.validator`

  The `Validator` export is no longer a class. It is now a discriminated union
  type of all validators where the `.kind` as the discriminator. The `Validator`
  type still has three type parameters with only the first (the TypeScript type
  enforced by the validator) required.

  These are breaking changes if you're using the two optional type parameters of
  `Validator` or doing `instanceof` checks with `Validator`! We apologize for
  the inconvenience. The same users this affects should be the ones that most
  benefit from the ability to work with validator types more directly.

- Argument validators now accept validators (object validators and union
  validators) in addition to objects with validators as properties. Return value
  validators similarly accept either validators or objects with validators as
  properties, but unlike `args:` any validator is allowed.

  Custom function wrappers (AKA middleware) should continue to work, but to
  present the same API has the builtin Convex function wrappers `query`,
  `internalQuery`, `mutation` etc. you'll need to update such code to accept
  either a validator or an object of validators. You'll likely want to update
  these anyway to support return value validators. The new `asValidator` helper
  maybe useful here.

- The default tsconfig.json created in projects when first creating the
  `convex/` directory now uses `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"`. This is just a
  better default, you
  [probably never want the previous default `"node"`/`"node10"`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#moduleResolution).
